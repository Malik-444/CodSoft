Usage
The calculator is very simple to use. Just enter the numbers and operators you want to use, and then click the "Equals" button to see the result.
For example, to calculate 2 + 2, you would enter 2 + 2 into the display and then click the "Equals" button. The calculator would display the result, which is 4.

You can also use the calculator to perform more complex operations, such as multiplication, division, and exponentiation. Just follow the same steps as above, but enter the appropriate operators and numbers.
